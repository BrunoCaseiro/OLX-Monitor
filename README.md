# OLX-Monitor
 This program allows you to automatically check for price changes on ads of your choice
 To add an ad to the watchlist, please fill in the "price.txt" file
 Everytime you run the program, it will check for price changes since the last time you ran it
 Obviously, when running for the first time every price will be marked as "NEW PRICE"
 You can also add search queries in a given district or even in the entire country by filling in the "query.txt" file
 This works in similar fashion, the program will let you know if any new ads are available (and their respective title and price) for a given search and location
 Do not use special characters in the queries and do not edit the files "priceDB.txt" and "queryDB.txt". This will lead to the program malfunctioning
